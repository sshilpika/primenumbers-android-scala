# Background

The goal of this example is to demonstrate the tradeoffs found in
the mobile + cloud architecture, where one has a choice between
doing work locally (on the mobile device) versus remotely (in 
the cloud) with different performance considerations in each case.

This is a very rough initial attempt and still needs significant work.

# Learning Objectives

- Show how CPU-intensive computation can be off-loaded from a mobile app to
  the cloud, by comparison to a mobile device, an unlimited resource for
  computation and storage.
- synchronous local foreground tasks in Android (running directly in an event listener)
- asynchronous local background tasks in Android using [AsyncTask](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html)
- asynchronous access of remote resources (usually RESTful web services) in Android using [AsyncHttpClient](http://loopj.com/android-async-http)

# TODO

* improve UI
* improve architecture
* architectural diagram
* testing
* define task in a way that it can be decomposed! 
  (e.g. each task to check divisibility within a specific range)
* typed AsyncTask that hides the need to use AnyRef for input and progress values
* make more functional
